 我之前比较热爱文学，写过一些诗歌和小说。之后逐渐更加喜欢历史与哲学，并尝试进行了一些思想史的写作，有些作品放到了github上。近期的研究让我对德意志地区的民族化与波兰立陶宛地区的民族化的对比产生兴趣，前者由破碎的邦国组成统一国家，后者由一个王国形成了不同国家，诞生了不同的民族神话。我在历史与哲学的阅读中不止一次关注技术系统与机制对人的塑造作用，我认为在未来数十年的能源转型中，新兴涌现的技术体系和人类对无碳能源发起的史无前例的挑战，将会重新塑造人类对整个世界和自身的看法。我对自己能够加入与之相关的研究充满热情，愿意在其中持之以恒地努力。

我也比较喜欢摄影，主要是风光与天文主题。星空在我的生命体验中占据很重要的地位。同时我也喜爱户外运动以及有些球类运动，我保持着每周规律运动的习惯。 
I used to have a strong passion for literature and have written some poetry and novels. However, over time, my interest gradually shifted towards history and philosophy, and I have ventured into writing about intellectual history. Some of my works are available on [GitHub](https://dichter97.github.io/archives/). Recently, my research has sparked an interest in comparing the process of nationalization in the Germanic region and the Polish-Lithuanian region. The former was comprised of fragmented states that eventually formed a unified nation, while the latter emerged from a single kingdom and gave rise to different countries, each with its own national mythology. In my readings of history and philosophy, I have often contemplated the role of technological systems and mechanisms in shaping human beings. I believe that in the coming decades of energy transition, the emergence of new technological systems and  humanity's pursuit of carbon-neutral energy will reshape humanity's perception of the world and ourselves. I am passionate about the opportunity to contribute to relevant research and I am committed to persistent efforts in this field.

I also have a strong interest in photography, particularly in capturing landscapes and astronomical subjects. The night sky holds significant importance in my life experiences. Additionally, I enjoy outdoor activities and some ball sports, maintaining a regular exercise routine on a weekly basis.
