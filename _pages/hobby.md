In the past, I had a strong passion for literature and wrote some poetry and novels. However, over time, I developed a greater interest in history and philosophy. I enjoy engaging in philosophical contemplation and seeking truth. I have ventured into writing about intellectual history, Some of my works are available on [GitHub](https://dichter97.github.io/archives/). Recently, my research has sparked an interest in comparing the process of nationalization in the Germanic region and the Polish-Lithuanian region. The former was comprised of fragmented states that eventually formed a unified nation, while the latter emerged from a single kingdom and gave rise to different countries, each with its own national mythology. In my readings of history and philosophy, I have often contemplated the role of technological systems and mechanisms in shaping human beings. I believe that in the coming decades of energy transition, the emergence of new technological systems and  humanity's pursuit of carbon-neutral energy will reshape humanity's perception of the world and ourselves. I am passionate about the opportunity to contribute to relevant research and I am committed to persistent efforts in this field.

I also have a strong interest in photography, particularly in capturing landscapes and astronomical subjects. The sky of stars holds significant importance in my life experiences. Additionally, I enjoy outdoor activities and some ball sports, maintaining a regular exercise routine on a weekly basis.
